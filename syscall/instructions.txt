1.
Go to kernel folder, then include/linux
In file called syscalls.h, comment out the last  line where it says
asm linkage sys_hello

2. 
Replace hello folder in kernel folder with the new one

3.
Replace userspace.c with new one
gcc userspace.c
./a.out
If it returns 0 then it's good
Dmesg to see if the correct parameters were printed

4. Then recompile kernel
In kernel folder, make menuconfig, save then exit
I use this command to compile everything
Depending on how many cores you can use change the 8 to 4 or whatever
sudo make -j 8 && sudo make modules_install -j 8 && sudo make install -j 8

5. Problem is in hello.c in the hello folder in kernel directory.
Trying to use hashtable from include/linux, but don't understand how to structure nodes
to add strings to the hashtable
Only helpful source I found was:
